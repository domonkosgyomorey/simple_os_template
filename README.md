# Simple 32bit OS template
## Description
A little abstracted 32bit OS template with some function

- Compiler: [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- Linker: [ld (GNU linker)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld)
- hardware emulation: [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/)
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## What it can do?
- Interaction with hardware throught IO ports
- Basic libc lib, with some function
- Basic keyboard handling with callback abstraction
